"""
Part 1 : struct

An alternative to the namedtuple construct in the Python collections module.
This module creates classes with a fixed set of slots

For historical reasons, this library is known as the "quick class" library.
There are however two ways to build a quick class in this framework:
1. Inherit the struct class defined here.
2. Create a class by calling the struct_type function.

The only differences between using a quick class and a normal class
definition are as follows.

1. A default constructor is provided that takes positional or keyword
   arguments to initialize the slots declared.
2. The methods __str__, __repr__, __eq__, and __ne__ are predefined.
3. The types of the class's slots (attributes) can optionally be defined
   (via the _slots class variable in a class declaration or additional
   arguments to the struct_type function) and checked at run time.

The differences between a class created through this package and one created
through collections.namedtuple are as follows.

1. Objects created via this library are not iterable.
2. The attributes in objects created by this library are writable.

NOTE: To disable type checking (for speed), add the following method
after and outside your class's definition. Substitute your class's name
for the name YOURCLASS

    YOURCLASS.__setattr__ = object.__setattr__

"""

# Reasons for doing this:

# Less code to define a class and no need for a maker function means it
# is far less error prone.

# Type checking makes debugging easier since execution halts at the
# source of the problem (the assignment violation) versus later on (when
# accessed/used as an unexpected type).

# Built in "to string" representation (__str__ method) also makes
# debugging easier.

# As with manually declaring classes with a __slots__ class variable,
# objects enforce their predefined slot attributes and those attributes
# are still mutable (unlike namedtuples).

class struct( object ):
    """ The base class for all classes created using this framework.
        Note that the methods contained herein apply to classes inheriting
        struct; it is not expected that classes declared as inheriting
        struct would define their own methods, much less redefine
        these.
        That being said, since struct's subclasses will not explicitly
        contain their own constructors, programmers of those subclasses must
        be familiar with the API for the constructor defined here.

        struct expects its subclasses to have one of the following
        two class variables defined:

        If __slots__ is defined, it is a tuple of names of class slots,
        or attributes, represented as strings. These names are assumed
        to be exactly the set of slots to be initialized, set, and
        otherwise accessed. (Python enforces this.) However, the slots
        can have any value; there is no type checking.
        Example:
            class Student( struct ):
                __slots__ = ( "age", "gpa" )

        If _slots is defined, it is a tuple of tuples. The inner
        tuples are all of length 2. The first value of each such
        pair is either a type or a tuple of types. The second
        value is the name of the slot, as in the __slots__ case above.
        It works just like the first case with __slots__, but now
        the values that may be assigned to the slots must be of
        (one of) the type(s) associated with it.
        Example:
            class Student( struct ):
                _slots = ( (int,"age"), ((str,float),"gpa") )

        The one exception is that, instead of a type one may use the string
        name of the class being built. This is the way one refers to the
        type one is building for structurally recursive types.
        Note that mutually recursive types are not (yet) supported.

        The class returned can be constructed using the provided name and
        either positional or keyword arguments. See the __init__ method
        for struct

        slotDecls: a sequence of slot declarations
        Each slot declaration provided is a 2-tuple, with the slot's type
        or tuple of types first and the slot's name second.
        The one exception is that, instead of a type one may use the string
        name of the class being built. This is the way one refers to the
        type one is building for structurally recursive types.

        Note that mutually recursive types are not (yet) supported.

        The class returned can be constructed using the provided name and
        either positional or keyword arguments. See the __init__ method
        for struct
